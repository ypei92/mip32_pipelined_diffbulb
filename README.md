# mip32_pipelined_diffbulb

This is how a general pipelined 32-bit MIPS processor looks. Written in verilog by Yan Pei and Yanghan Wang.

• Implemented forwarding, branch prediction, hazard detection based on 5-stage pipelined structure
• Revised processor structure by implementing multiple kinds of bubble process mechanism
